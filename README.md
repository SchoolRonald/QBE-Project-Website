# Mines AI & Machine Learning Club — Site (Svelte)

This is a small Svelte + Vite scaffold for the Colorado School of Mines AI & ML Club. It contains three pages: Home, Upcoming Events, and Contact.

Quick start

```bash
# from project root
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173

Notes

- This is a simple single-page Svelte app using hash-based routing for ease of demo.
- The contact form is a demo (no backend). I can add a real backend (Netlify functions, Formspree, or your preferred endpoint) if you want.
- Logo and illustration are simple SVGs included in `src/assets`. We can replace them with specific images/logos you prefer.
